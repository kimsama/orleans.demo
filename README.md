# orleans.demo
Orleans demo base on orleans 1.0.9


@kims: A brief note atfter trying this project.

## What is it?

Similar as the *Presence* sample contained Orleans on the github repository but more specific on a game.

Unlike the *Presense* sample, it includes the following features:

* Surppot room based game play mamagement
* Support quick match (Though it looks like a trivial but it exist)
* Use gRPC for the communication protocol

## How to build

Without building Orleans from scratch, it can be quickly done with installation of the following packages via Nuget. Be sure the version of the packages, even with the latest stable version, it couldn't build without error.

<center>Package          | <center>Version
----------------------------|-------------------------
 OrleansRuntime           |  1.0.9
 OrleansProviders         |  1.0.9
 Grpc                           |  0.6.0
 Grpc.Core                   |  0.6.0
 Grpc.Auth                   |  0.6.0
 grpc.native.csharp_ext  |  0.10.0

 > NOTE: `OrleansProviders` can not be automatically installed with `OrleansRuntime`, in that case it should be manually installed.

## Run  

After succesfully building the solution, you will get  four execulatble files.

1. Run `OrleansSilo.exe`
2. Run `ProcessManager.exe`
3. Open cmdline then run `LoadGenerator.exe` with the appropriate arguments.
```
>LoadGenerator.exe 0 8
```
> NOTE: The first argument, 0 is start index for quick match and the second one is number of players.
4. `LoadGenerator.exe` will automatically run `SessionLauncher.exe`

## Storage

See the *'DevTestServerConfiguration.xml'* if you want to eanble Sample.FileStorage of orleans.

```xml
ï»¿<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<OrleansConfiguration xmlns="urn:orleans">
  <Globals>
    <StorageProviders>
      <Provider Type="Orleans.Storage.MemoryStorage" Name="PubSubStore" />
      <!-- To test the sample storage providers, uncomment one of the following two lines: -->
      <Provider Type="Orleans.Storage.MemoryStorage" Name="MemoryStore" />
      <!-- <Provider Type="Samples.StorageProviders.MongoDBStorage" Name="TestStore" Database="orleanssamples" ConnectionString="mongodb://localhost:27017/" />
      <Provider Type="Samples.StorageProviders.OrleansFileStorage" Name="TestStore" RootDirectory=".\Samples.FileStorage"/>       -->
      <Provider Type="Samples.StorageProviders.OrleansFileStorage" Name="TestStore" RootDirectory=".\Samples.FileStorage"/>
```

As the comment told, you can uncomment and use one of the storage what you want to.
